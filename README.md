# Flow
An open source split mechanical keyboard powered by [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) and kicad
kinda a ripoff of Cride's Fissure keyboard
## WARNING:
The pcb has not been tested as of 2022/01/31. 
If you are going to print the pcb (tented) you must buy each part of the keyboard separately being the main body, thumb cluster and bridge
