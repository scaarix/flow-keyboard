# Updates
- REBUILDING THE DESIGN FROM THE GROUND UP
I didn't really like where I was going with this keyboard design and wanted to change the overall look and feel of the keyboard and the features that I want with this board
# Features
- Hotswappable with mx-style switches
- Flippable PCB
- 4 Key Thumb Cluster

## TODO
- [ ] Finish layout (ergogen)
- [ ] Make keyboard outline (ergogen) 
- [ ] Create pcb (ergogen)

# Goals
- Have hotswap with choc, kailh box etc.
- Be wireless
- Have RGB if I can actually configure it properly
